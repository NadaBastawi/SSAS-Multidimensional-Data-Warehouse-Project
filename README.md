# SSAS-Multidimensional-Data-Warehouse-Project

This repository contains my implementation of **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)** labs from the book  
**"The Data Warehouse Lab: A Step-by-Step Guide using SSIS and SSAS 2017" by Amin Jalali.**

## 📘 Overview
The project demonstrates how to design and deploy a **multidimensional data model** using SSAS.  
It includes steps to create data cubes, define dimensions and hierarchies, and design measures for analytical queries.

Key objectives include:
- Building a multidimensional OLAP cube.
- Defining dimensions, hierarchies, and calculated measures.
- Processing and deploying cubes to the SSAS server.
- Running MDX queries for business intelligence analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS 2017)**
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **Visual Studio (SSDT)**
- **MDX (Multidimensional Expressions)**
